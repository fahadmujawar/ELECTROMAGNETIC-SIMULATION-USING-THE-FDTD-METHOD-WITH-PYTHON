# Electromagnetic Simulation using the FDTD Method with Python

Welcome to the Electromagnetic Simulation project! This repository showcases simulations of 1D, 2D, and 3D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) methods, inspired by the work of Jennifer E. Houlie and Allen Taflove. Whether you're a student, researcher, or professional, this project will offer valuable insights into the fascinating world of electromagnetics.
