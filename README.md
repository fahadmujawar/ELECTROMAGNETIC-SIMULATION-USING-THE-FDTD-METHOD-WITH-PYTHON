# Electromagnetic Simulation using the FDTD Method with Python

Welcome to the Electromagnetic Simulation project! This repository showcases simulations of 1D, 2D, and 3D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) methods, inspired by the work of Jennifer E. Houlie and Allen Taflove. Whether you're a student, researcher, or professional, this project will offer valuable insights into the fascinating world of electromagnetics.

## Introduction
This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the FDTD method and its applications in simulating electromagnetic waves. The repository includes well-documented Python scripts and detailed explanations of various scenarios.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run the simulations, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## Simulations
The project consists of the following simulations:

1D Simulation - Simulating wave propagation in a one-dimensional space.

2D Simulation - Simulating wave interactions in a two-dimensional plane.

3D Simulation - Exploring complex wave dynamics in a three-dimensional environment.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or new features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
